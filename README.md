MarketMate is a user friendly  “Campus Catalogue application” that allows campus residents to browse menus, place orders from local restaurants available, send files beforehand to available stationares and easily access up-to-date information about shops and services within the campus. The app provides a comprehensive list of shops and services, including their operating hours, menus, and services lists.

If the shop is currently open, users can place an order directly from within the app, which will be processed by the shop. This feature saves users the time and effort of visiting the shop to place an order physically.

It also allows shops and services to update their information in real-time, ensuring that the information displayed is always accurate and up-to-date. 

Overall, this app is an essential tool for campus residents who want to quickly and easily access information about the shops and services available on campus and conveniently place orders for their favorite meals and services without physically visiting the shop.
